                Hi, I'm Robel. I'm an aspiring software engineer based in
                Philadelphia. I create software and love solving complex
                problems. I'm passionate about working on projects that improve
                performance and make a meaningful impact.
                This site showcases my journey through tech, including co-op experiences,
                personal projects, and community driven initiatives.

                    <p>
                        I'm a 4th year (out of 5) Computer Science student at
                        Drexel University, with a concentration in Software Engineering.
                        Originally, I grew up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where I developed a
                        passion for technology and problem solving. 
                    </p>
                    Throughout my studies and co-op experiences, I've gained hands on experience with a
                    range of skills and technologies, including:
                    <ul class="tech-list">
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>C</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, diving into the Star Wars
                        universe, and playing video games. My love for these interests often inspires the
                        personal projects I create, as I enjoy coding things that align with what I'm passionate
                        about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm always looking for ways to work on projects that improve performance and make an impact,
                        whether through my co-op experiences or side projects.
